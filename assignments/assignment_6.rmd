The goal of this problem is to estimate the regression function of acceleration vs time for the `mcycle` data in the package `MASS`, using cubic smoothing splines.

```{r}
library(MASS)
library(splines)
```

## A
For a reasonable range of smoothing parameters $\lambda$, compute and plot the generalized cross validation measure $GCV(\lambda)$ and find the optimal smoothing parameter.

## B
Using the Demmler-Reinsch basis representation, how many basis functions contribute significantly to the fit, as determined, for instance, by accumulating $90\%$ of the total degrees of freedom?
