## Example:
Generate sample of $n=5$ points from $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$.
``ecdf(x)`` creates an "object" that represents $F_n(t)$.
The $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ distribution function $F(t)$ is ``pnorm(t)``.
To plot this we create a grid of values of $t$ and evaluate and evaluate ``pnorm()`` at that grid.
```{r}
x <- rnorm(n = 5)
plot(x = ecdf(x))
t <- seq(from = -5, to = 5, length.out = 20)
plot(t, pnorm(t))
t <- seq(from = -5, to = 5, length.out = 200)
plot(t, pnorm(t))
plot(t, pnorm(t), type = "l")
lines(t, pnorm(t))
x <- rnorm(n = 20)
plot(x = ecdf(x))
lines(t, pnorm(t), col = "red")
x <- rnorm(n = 100)
plot(x = ecdf(x))
lines(t, pnorm(t), col = "red")
x <- rnorm(n = 500)
plot(x = ecdf(x))
lines(t, pnorm(t), col = "red")

```
