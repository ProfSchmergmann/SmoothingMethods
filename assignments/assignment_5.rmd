The goal of this problem is to estimate the regression function of acceleration vs time for the `mcycle` data in the package `MASS`.
Show that the Nadaraya-Watson estimator can be expressed as $\hat{Y} = HY.
Find the "hat matrix" H explicitly.
For a reasonable range of bandwidths $h$, compute and plot the generalized cross validation measure $GCV(h)$ and find the optimal bandwidth.

require(MASS)
